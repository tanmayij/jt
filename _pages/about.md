Hi! I am a Software Engineer and currently, a Computer Science Master's applicant. I studied Computer Science Engineering at [Andhra University, India](https://www.andhrauniversity.edu.in). I have been working with [Wipro Limited](https://www.wipro.com) as a Project Engineer for two years now, in the telecommunications domain. I am also a part-time law student specialising in Cyber Laws at [NALSAR, Hyderabad](https://www.nalsar.ac.in).

My academic interests include Data and Internet Privacy Technologies, Community-owned Mesh Networks for ensuring sustainability, transparency, and inclusion, Cyber Laws and IPRs across the globe. Currently set out to understand and develop privacy-enhancing technologies for Community and Online Social Networks.

I also dwell wherever poetry and literature are. I have a published anthology, called Eternities Spent in Contemplation, and two blogs on [WordPress](https://tanmayatvam.wordpress.com), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/whatamibutpaper/)(for more visual content), where I try to combine poetry with everything else. I'm also a regular practitioner of Yoga and Kathak (an Indian classical dance form). I am on a constant quest to understand and overlap humanities with technology and law.
