Hi! I am a Computer Science Master's applicant. I studied Computer Science Engineering at [Andhra University, India](https://www.andhrauniversity.edu.in). I have been working with [Wipro Limited](https://www.wipro.com) as a Project Engineer for two years now, in the telecommunications domain. I am also a part-time law student specialising in Cyber Laws at [NALSAR, Hyderabad](https://www.nalsar.ac.in).

My academic interests include LegalTech aspects of Data and Internet Privacy and Cyber Forensics. Currently set out to understand and develop privacy-preserving AI tools for Online Social Networks.

I also dwell wherever poetry and literature are. I have a published anthology, called Eternities Spent in Contemplation, and a [blog](https://www.instagram.com/tanmayij_/) where I try to combine poetry with everything else. I'm also a regular practitioner of Yoga and Kathak (an Indian classical dance form).
